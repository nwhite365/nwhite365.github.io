    I am interested in <strong>Human-Robot Interaction</strong>, specifically how we can enable robots to be easier and more intuitive in everyday use. My work seeks to design and develop robot tools and interactions using the input of stakeholders. In my work, I believe in the importance of working with end-users to better understand their preferences and needs, and to ensure the usability and applicability of my work within real-world contexts. In my current work, I use this collaboration and understanding to develop creative solutions that seek to simplify the usage of collaborative robots (cobots), allowing for a more complete realization of their collaborative potential and better supporting users in their interactions with cobots.
