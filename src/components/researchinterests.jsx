    <Typography>
      I am interested in <strong>human-robot interaction</strong> and designing interactions and systems that simplify complexity and enable more users to utilize and interact with robots. 
      My research focuses on methods for <strong>supporting user interaction</strong> with collaborative robots, helping them to create and execute programs and plans for collaboration. 
      The systems I build are designed to support user knowledge and decision making as users determine how to create collaborative interactions between cobots and operators, while ensuring the collaborations are safe and effective.
