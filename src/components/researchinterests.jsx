      I love working with robots and thinking about how they can help benefit the people that use them. My research focuses on methods for <strong>supporting user interaction</strong> with collaborative robots, helping them create and program plans for collaboration. In this way, the systems I build are designed to support user knowledge and help individuals make decisions that support cobot operators to have safe and effective collaborations.
