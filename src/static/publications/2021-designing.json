    "title": "Designing emotionally expressive social commentary to facilitate child-robot interaction",
    "abstract": "Emotion expression in human-robot interaction has been widely explored, however little is known about how such expressions should be coupled with feelings and opinions expressed by a social robot. We explored how 12 children experienced emotionally expressive social commentaries from a reading companion robot across five interaction styles that differed in their non-verbal emotional expressiveness and opinionated conversational styles (neutral, divergent, or convergent opinions). We found that, while the robot’s opinions and non-verbal emotion expressions affected children’s experiences with the robot, the speech content of the commentaries was the more prominent factor in their experience. Additionally, children differed in their perceptions of social commentary: while some expressed a sense of connection-making with the robot’s self-disclosure commentaries, others felt distracted by them or felt like the robot was off-topic. We recommend designers pay particular attention to the robot’s speech content and consider children’s individual differences in designing emotional and opinionated speech.",
