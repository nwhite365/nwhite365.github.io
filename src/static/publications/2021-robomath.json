    "title": "RoboMath: Designing a Learning Companion Robot to Support Children's Numerical Skills",
    "abstract": "Children's early numerical knowledge establishes a foundation for later development of mathematics achievement and playing linear number board games is effective in improving basic numerical abilities. Besides the visuo-spatial cues provided by traditional number board games, learning companion robots can integrate multi-sensory information and offer social cues that can support children's learning experiences. We explored how young children experience sensory feedback (audio and visual) and social expressions from a robot when playing a linear number board game, “RoboMath.” We present the interaction design of the game and our investigation of children's (n = 19, aged 4) and parents' experiences under three conditions: (1) visual-only, (2) audio-visual, and (3) audiovisual-social robot interaction. We report our qualitative analysis, including the themes observed from interviews with families on their perceptions of the game and the interaction with the robot, their child's experiences, and their design recommendations.",
