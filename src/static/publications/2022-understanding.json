    "abstract": "Social robots are emerging as learning companions for children, and research shows that they facilitate the development of interest and learning even through brief interactions. However, little is known about how such technologies might support these goals in authentic environments over long-term periods of use and interaction. We designed a learning companion robot capable of supporting children reading popular-science books by expressing social and informational commentaries. We deployed the robot in homes of 14 families with children aged 10â€“12 for four weeks during the summer. Our analysis revealed critical factors that affected children's long-term engagement and adoption of the robot, including external factors such as vacations, family visits, and extracurricular activities; family/parental involvement; and children's individual interests. We present four in-depth cases that illustrate these factors and demonstrate their impact on children's reading experiences and discuss the implications of our findings for robot design.",
