    "title": "Designing Emotional Expressions for a Reading Companion Robot",
    "abstract": "Advancements in affective science and robotics have allowed researchers to consider how robots can express emotions appropriately in humanrobot interaction. Borrowing previous work from theories of nonverbal expressions of emotion, we designed 24 distinct emotional expressions for a reading companion robotâ€“Misty II. We validated the expressions with and without social context using crowdsourcing methods. The current work aims to provide a publicly available set of emotional expressions for robots to advance research on emotional responsiveness in human-robot interaction.",
