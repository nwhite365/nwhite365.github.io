    "description": "Robo-Blocks is an interface designed to assist users in end-user robot programming through narrative programming. Users engage in narrative creation, goal generation, programing and simulation, and deployment and testing. Using LLMs, we support users as they create a narrative they want a robot to act out, and continue to support users as they create and execute a plan to program the robot.",
